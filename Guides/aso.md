# App Store Search Optimization Guide

In this guide, I'll talk about strategies for optimizing your app's visibility and discoverability on the App Store through effective search optimization techniques.

## Understanding App Store Search

### 1. Importance of Search Visibility
App Store search is a primary method for users to discover new apps. Optimizing your app's presence in search results is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting potential users.

In my case of Trading Tracker, I earn about **+$3000 a month** and all users are organic. I don't do any marketing yet and this goes to show how important ASO really is. Just think about how the revenue can grow if I would spend some time on marketing. 

### 2. Algorithm Factors
The App Store search algorithm considers various factors when ranking apps, including app title, keywords, description, ratings, reviews, and download velocity. Understanding these factors is essential for optimizing your app's search performance.

## Keyword Research and Optimization

Let's breakdown my Trading Tracker ASO attributes

```
Title: Trading Tracker for traders
Subtitle: Analyse and journal trades
Keywords: 
day,analytics,options,investment,portfolio,market,tradervue,stock,trading,strategy,journal,tracking
```

### 1. Title
Title is the most important field when it comes to ASO. This is what the AppStore users see at first. There are some rules when it comes to choosing the right title.

- Don't put your app's name in the title
  - You don't want to waste valuable characters by putting your app's name here. Users searching AppStore have no idea what *"[your app name]"* is.
  - If your app is a habit tracker, you should put *"Habit tracker"* in the title
  

### 2. Subtitle
Subtitle is the second most important attribute for ASO. It should not contain any words that are already in the title. You should expand the title and explain a little more what your app is about.

> Remember, both Title and Subtitle count as keywords. The #1 rule of ASO is to not repeat keywords in multiple fields!

### 3. Keywords
Keywords are a third most important part of ASO. You can use tools like [Astro](https://tryastro.app) to research the best keywords. There are some rules for keywords:

- Whitespace characters count as a regular character. Don't use them.
- Keywords have to be separated by comma, nothing else.
- Don't repeat the keywords from title and subtitle.
- Don't use plural form of words. AppStore is automatically ranking your app for plural forms.
- For keywords that contain multiple words like *"day trading"* you should put in two separate keywords *"day"* and *"trading"*. AppStore automatically rank for all combinations of your keywords.

> [!TIP]
> The AppStore Search algorithms change and so we have to always research, test and adapt for what's working. Experimentation is important here. What was working a year ago might not work today. Remember that.

### 4. Screenshots
Screenshots are essential when it comes to ASO and increasing your conversion rates. Screenshots are not used for keywords or ASO in terms of algorithms but think about screenshots as a storefront. If the screenshots are interesting, the user will visit your AppStore page and can potentially become your paying customer.

It's very important to spend time designing your screenshots and make them visually appealing. And no, putting screenshots of your app there is usually not enough. 

### 5. Reviews
Reviews and ratings are what makes your app rank higher. Keeping this number as high as possible is the main goal here. I talk more about reviews in [this guide](reviews.md) so make sure to go through that.

### 6. Description
Description is not that important for ASO. AppStore, unlike Google PlayStore does not track description for keywords. It is important, however, to spend some time writing your description. It essentially introduces your app to potential customers. It's also worth noting that only a small percentage of AppStore users actually read descriptions.
