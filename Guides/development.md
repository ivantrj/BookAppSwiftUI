# App Development Guide

In this guide, I'll discuss strategies for developing apps quickly and efficiently while maintaining focus and perseverance throughout the process.

## MVP Mindset

This one is very important. If you don't know, MVP stand for *Minimal Viable Product*. By defining a clear picture of your MVP, you're setting yourself for a potential success when it comes to releasing your app.

You see, it's very common in the indie dev community to start new project and then quit a few days later for multiple reasons: lack of motivation, lack of discipline, lack of planning, comparing yourself to others, and so on... 

I've been there and quit multiple projects of mine because of the stuff I mentioned.

### 1. Define Core Features
Prioritize essential features that address the core needs of your target audience. Identify the minimum set of functionalities required to deliver value to users and focus on implementing these features first.

### 2. Be Honest with Yourself
Does your app make sense to you? Would you use your app? Does it solve a problem you have? If yes, then it's a great candidate for a profitable app business. If you're not sure about the answers for these questions, there are some steps you can do.

### 3. Validate 
Before you even start building your app idea, you can validate your idea by posting it on social media, asking your friends, or asking other fellow devs on Twitter in `#buildinpubic` community for example. Remember, if there's one person out there other than you that will use your app, it's worth bulding it. Why? If there's one person, there's a big chance that there are thousands more people like this.

### 3. Iterate
Build your MVP first with the most important features. Don't waste time with *Change password* or *Forgot password*. You can do it manually for the first few months. Focus on what's truly important - your idea and business logic of your app.

After you release your MVP and gain some traction, you can easily implement more and more features.

> ### Implementing new features
> The mistake I made was that I built features that nobody asked for. I wasted so much time by building useless features. Make sure to have an easy to use feedback solution in your app so the users can reach out and request new features.
> Use solutions like [WishKit](https://www.wishkit.io/) by [Martin Lasek](https://twitter.com/MartinLasek) (Coming soon to SwiftReads codebase!) to gather valuable feedback. Implement features based on this feedback. You'll thank yourself in the future.

## Do not quit

It's incredibly easy to quit building your app. Why is that? Our emotions. Nothing else. It's important to understand what are the things that want you to quit and fail. Building your own app business is a battle of you vs. you.

### 1. Break Things Down
The first thing that comes to mind when I talk about quitting is to quit because you don't even know where to start. It's so common for us to not work on our project because it seems to be so big that we don't even feel like starting.

In reality, if you break down your project into multiple steps and tasks, it's much easier to stay comitted and do something every day. Use tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/) to split your app into tasks and features. 

It's important to show up every day and be disciplined about it. Do one task a day. Be 1% better every single day and you'll release a beautiful app by the end of it.

### 2. Be Consistent
If you fail to show up for a few days, you might feel like it's not worth it anymore. This is also one of the reasons why most people quit even before they finish. It's really important to realize that it's a marathon, not a sprint. Even if you skip a few days of building, get back on the horse and keep building. 

> [!TIP]
> If you don't feel like building and would rather watch YouTube videos, it's because you're scared that you'll fail. It's a very common emotion and it's important to be aware of it. Give yourself 5 minutes to work on your app and then stop. 80% of the time you'll keep working after the 5 minutes.

### 3. Adjust Your Expectations
Now, this section is not something you want to hear but it's important you're aware. Most of the apps on the AppStore fail. It's usually not because they are bad apps. It's because the developer quits before the app gets profitable. It takes time for your app to find your audience. 

Why developers quit? Expectations. You, me, most of us have expectations. Especially if we see someone being successful. We see ourselves to be them, live their lives and be successful as well. We build our projects with this expectation in mind and then when we release the app the reality hits hard. 

We have no downloads and sales for days and weeks. And so we quit because the app didn't meet our expectations. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *On average, only ~17% of apps reach $1k monthly revenue, but of those that do, 59% of them reach $2.5k, and then 60% of those reach $5k.*
> 
> *- RevenueCat - [State of Subscription Apps 2024](https://www.revenuecat.com/state-of-subscription-apps-2024/)*

The quote from above says it all. Adjust your expectations according to that. With that being said, if you for whatever reason won't be in the 17% that make it, learn to move on quickly.

Use it as a learning experience and build something else. The goal of SwiftReads and indie development in general is to build quickly, validate, iterate when it makes sense. If your validation shows that it doesn't make sense to continue building, quit the project. Move on to the next one.
