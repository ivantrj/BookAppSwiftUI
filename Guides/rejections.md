## Understanding App Store Guidelines

### 1. Familiarize Yourself
Thoroughly review and understand Apple's [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) before submitting your app. Familiarize yourself with the rules and requirements to ensure compliance and minimize the risk of rejection.

### 2. Stay Updated
Stay informed about updates and changes to the App Store guidelines. Apple periodically updates its guidelines to reflect evolving industry standards and best practices. Stay updated to avoid submitting apps that may violate new or revised guidelines.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Bugs and Crashes
Ensure your app is thoroughly tested and free of bugs, crashes, and performance issues before submission. Conduct comprehensive testing on multiple devices and iOS versions to identify and resolve any issues that may lead to rejection.

### 2. In-App Purchases
If your app offers In-App Purchases, it's important to follow the guildelines and include the required information to your paywall. I go into more details in [this guide](paywall.md) where I breakdown the paywall and all required details.

The most common rejection reason are missing Privacy Policy and EULA links. Make sure to check [this section](paywall.md#8-required-links) to understand these links.

Restore purchase functionality is also required and might lead to app rejections if missed. Check [this section](paywall.md#9-restore-purchase) for more details.

### 2. Incomplete Information
Provide accurate and complete information in your app metadata, including app description, screenshots, and preview videos. Incomplete or misleading information can result in rejection due to non-compliance with App Store guidelines.

### 3. Violation of Guidelines
Avoid violations of App Store guidelines, including those related to content, functionality, user interface, and privacy. Common violations include using unauthorized APIs, misleading advertising, and collecting user data without consent.

### 4. Intellectual Property Infringement
Ensure your app and its content do not infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, and patents. Obtain necessary permissions and licenses for any copyrighted materials used in your app to avoid rejection.

### 5. User Experience Issues
Prioritize user experience and usability in your app design and functionality. Avoid confusing navigation, unintuitive user interfaces, and disruptive or intrusive advertisements that may lead to poor user reviews and rejection.

## Preparing for Submission

### 1. Thorough Review Process
Do a comprehensive review of your app to ensure compliance with App Store guidelines before submission. Address any issues or violations identified during the review process to minimize the risk of rejection.

### 2. Beta Testing and Feedback
Utilize beta testing and gather feedback from testers to identify and address any potential issues or concerns before submitting your app for review. Incorporate feedback and iterate on your app to improve its quality and increase the likelihood of approval.
